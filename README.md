This README provides an overview of a decentralized advertising framework for the Fediverse using the ActivityPub protocol. The framework aims to provide a viable revenue stream for server operators and content creators, while respecting user privacy and control.

## Key Features

1. [**Ads as Activities**](./docs/Decentralized_Advertising_Fediverse_ActivityPub.md#ads-as-activities): Advertisements are treated as specialized ActivityPub activities, allowing for native distribution and interaction within the Fediverse.

2. [**User Preferences**](./docs/Decentralized_Advertising_Fediverse_ActivityPub.md#user-preferences): Users have granular control over the type of ads they see, with options to fine-tune or opt-out.

3. [**Server-Side Logic**](./docs/Decentralized_Advertising_Fediverse_ActivityPub.md#server-side-logic): Handles ad validation, user matching, ad display, metrics collection, and revenue distribution.

4. [**Client Extensions**](./docs/Decentralized_Advertising_Fediverse_ActivityPub.md#client-extensions): Modifications to ActivityPub clients for a seamless user experience, including ad preferences UI, ad display, ad interactions, and opt-out option.

7. [**Opt-Out & Consent**](./docs/Decentralized_Advertising_Fediverse_ActivityPub.md#opt-out--consent): Mechanisms for user opt-out and consent management.

8. [**Budget Management and Billing**](./docs/Decentralized_Advertising_Fediverse_ActivityPub.md#budget-management-and-billing): Explains how advertisers set budgets for their ad campaigns, how these budgets are distributed and tracked across the network, and how billing is handled.

9. [**Monetization**](./docs/Decentralized_Advertising_Fediverse_ActivityPub.md#monetization): Revenue generation and distribution models, including Pay-Per-Click (PPC), Pay-Per-Impression (PPI), and Pay-Per-Interaction (PPIx).
