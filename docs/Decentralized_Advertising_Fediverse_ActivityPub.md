## Introduction

The Fediverse, a decentralized network of social media platforms, offers a privacy-focused alternative to traditional, centralized platforms. However, its growth and sustainability face significant challenges due to a lack of viable monetization options. Server maintenance and moderation require financial resources, and relying solely on volunteers and donations is not scalable. This document proposes a decentralized advertising system built atop the ActivityPub protocol as a solution to these challenges. The system aims to provide relevant, user-controlled advertising that respects privacy, offers robust monetization, and seamlessly integrates with the existing ActivityPub ecosystem.

## Goals

1. **Sustainability**: Provide a viable revenue stream for server operators and content creators, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Fediverse.
  
2. **User Autonomy**: Give users control over their ad experience, with options to fine-tune or opt-out.

3. **Privacy**: Design the system with privacy as a cornerstone, aligning with the values of the Fediverse.

4. **Seamless Integration**: Leverage existing ActivityPub protocols for easy adoption and implementation.

5. **Transparency**: Maintain open standards and clear revenue sharing models for all stakeholders.

## ActivityPub Integration

### Ads as Activities
In this architecture, advertisements are treated as specialized ActivityPub activities, encoded in JSON-LD. This approach aims to unify the advertising model with the existing ActivityPub standards, making it easier for developers to implement the system.

Ads in this system are represented as specialized ActivityPub activities, allowing for native distribution and interaction within the Fediverse. By using activities, ads gain several advantages:

1. **Native Distribution**: Ads can be seamlessly federated across ActivityPub-compliant servers, reaching a wider audience without additional protocols.
  
2. **User Interaction**: The inherent interactivity of activities enables users to engage with ads through actions like 'Like,' 'Share,' or custom interactions defined for the advertising system.

3. **Structured Metadata**: Ads can carry additional metadata such as target demographics, monetization pointers, and more, all within the ActivityPub JSON-LD context.

For example, an ad activity could look like this:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "Ad",
  "content": "Buy this cool product!",
  "targetDemographics": ["18-35", "Tech enthusiasts"],
  "monetization": "payment_pointer_here"
}
```
This structure makes it easier for both servers and clients to handle ads in a standardized way, while providing advertisers with the ability to target their messages effectively.

#### Data Model

Ads are defined as a custom ActivityPub `type` called `Ad`. Here is an example data model for an ad:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "ad": "https://example.com/schema/Ad"
    }
  ],
  "type": "ad:Ad",
  "content": "String containing the ad content",
  "targetDemographics": ["Array", "of", "demographic", "tags"],
  "monetization": {
    "platform": "platform_payment_pointer",
    "creator": "creator_payment_pointer"
  }
}
```
#### Server-Side Handling
##### Validation: When an ad activity is received, the server should validate the JSON-LD against the predefined schema for ad:Ad. Any non-compliant activities should be rejected.

##### Routing: The server will route the ad activity based on the targetDemographics field, matching it against the AdPreferences of users on the instance.

#### Client-Side Handling
#####Display: Clients will recognize the ad:Ad type and can render it in a designated ad space within the UI.

##### Interaction: Users can interact with the ad through standard ActivityPub actions like Like, Dislike, or custom-defined ad interaction verbs.

#### Advantages
##### Standardization: By using ActivityPub, we ensure that ads can be federated across any ActivityPub-compliant server without needing a new protocol or standard.

##### Extensibility: The JSON-LD format is extensible, allowing for future additions to the ad format without breaking compatibility.

##### User Control: Representing ads as activities allows for user interaction and feedback, which can be used to refine ad targeting and performance metrics.

### User Preferences

User preferences for advertisements are also treated as specialized ActivityPub activities or as custom fields in a user's ActivityPub profile. This ensures that users have granular control over the type of ads they see, while also keeping their data within the ActivityPub ecosystem.

#### Data Model

Here's an example of a user preference modeled as a custom ActivityPub activity:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "AdPreferences",
  "actor": "user_account_uri",
  "categories": ["Tech", "Fashion"],
  "ageRange": "18-35",
  "exclude": ["Alcohol", "Gambling"]
}
```

#### Server-Side Handling
##### Preference Matching: When an ad is received, the server uses these preferences to decide which users are eligible to see the ad.

##### Updating Preferences: Servers should listen for updates to this AdPreferences activity to refresh user preferences in real-time.

#### lient-Side Handling
##### UI for Preferences: Clients should provide an intuitive UI where users can set and update their ad preferences.

##### Local Storage: These preferences can be stored locally on the client and synced with the server.

#### Advantages
##### User Autonomy: Users can fine-tune their ad experience, enabling or disabling categories as they see fit.

##### Privacy: All preferences are stored within the ActivityPub ecosystem, ensuring data isn't shared with external parties.

##### Dynamic Updating: As users change their preferences, these updates are immediately reflected in the ads they see, thanks to real-time syncing between clients and servers.

### User Preferences

User preferences for advertisements are treated as specialized ActivityPub activities or as custom fields in a user's ActivityPub profile. This approach is inspired by the original `ads.fed.json` concept and enhances it within the ActivityPub framework.

#### Data Model

Here's an updated example of a user preference modeled as a custom ActivityPub activity:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
  "type": "AdPreferences",
  "actor": "user_account_uri",
  "preferences": {
    "frequency": "Low",
    "format": ["Image", "Text"],
    "categories": ["Tech", "Fashion"]
  },
  "interests": ["Open Source", "Sustainability"],
  "exclusions": ["Alcohol", "Gambling"]
}
```

#### Sections Explained
##### User Preferences: This includes general settings such as ad frequency and preferred formats. It aligns with the user's overall ad experience expectations.

##### Interests and Keywords: This houses specific interests and keywords that the user wants to see ads about. Also includes 'exclusion keywords' for topics they don't want ads about, enhancing ad relevance.

#### Server-Side Handling
##### Preference Matching: When an ad is received, the server uses these preferences to decide which users are eligible to see the ad.

##### Updating Preferences: Servers should listen for updates to this AdPreferences activity to refresh user preferences in real-time.

#### Client-Side Handling
##### UI for Preferences: Clients should provide an intuitive UI where users can set and update their ad preferences, divided into the sections explained above.

##### Local Storage: These preferences can be stored locally on the client and synced with the server.

#### Advantages
##### User Autonomy: Users can fine-tune their ad experience, enabling or disabling categories as they see fit.

##### Privacy: All preferences are stored within the ActivityPub ecosystem, ensuring data isn't shared with external parties.

#####Dynamic Updating: As users change their preferences, these updates are immediately reflected in the ads they see, thanks to real-time syncing between clients and servers.
